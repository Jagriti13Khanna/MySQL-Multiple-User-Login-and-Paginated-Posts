# MySQL Multiple User Login and Paginated Posts
This is a help wanted job posting system. Visitors can view ads and can register to post their own ads. Once registered, they can log in and post a new help wanted ad. After they can mark a job as filled so it is no longer visible to the public, as unfilled so it is viewable again to the public, edit the job posting, and delete it from the system. The my ads page shows all active and inactive jobs for the logged in user to allow them to edit, activate, deactivate and delete all THEIR ads.
